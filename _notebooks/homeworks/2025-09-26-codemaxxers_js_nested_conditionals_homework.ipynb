It required careful planning to avoid mixing up logic, especially since the same temperature might lead to different actions depending on whether it’s day or night, or if someone is home.\n",
        "\n",
        "How did you decide on the structure of your nested conditionals in Problem 3?\n",
        "I started by identifying the primary condition: whether someone is home. From there, I created inner blocks for time of day if the home is occupied, and energy saving mode if not. Then, inside those, I handled specific temperature comparisons. This top-down approach helped keep the logic clear and avoided unnecessary repetition.\n",

        "Can you think of a real-world situation where you would need even MORE levels of nesting than Problem 3?\n",
        "Yes — managing airline booking systems could require deeper nesting. For example, checking a passenger’s ticket class, travel status (checked-in or not), seat availability, special needs (like meals or wheelchair access), and connecting flights — all in different combinations. Each of those layers could lead to more detailed decisions, making the nesting more complex than the thermostat system."
