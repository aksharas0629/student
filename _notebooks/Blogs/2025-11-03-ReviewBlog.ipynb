    "Test Corrections:\n",
    "1. The answer is B because the code segment assigns the initial value of the first to temp then assigns the intial value of second to first. The initial value of first which has been sotred in temp is then assigned to second. Therefor, the intial values of first and second have been interchanged. \n",
    "3. The answer is C because if data measurements need to be taken from many locations, it would be beneficial to have participants from around the world collect the data\n",
    "10. The code in Option B is correct because it describes how the circles are positioned. It starts the first circle right where it belongs, at the center (3, 6). Then, for the next two circles, it shifts the center 2 units to the right (that's the xPos + 2 part) AND 2 units down (that's the yPos - 2 part). This movement correctly plots the centers at (5, 4) and then (7, 2), tracing the figure's diagonal pattern.\n",
    "15. The answer is option C because You can only connect a new device to the internet because it gets assigned an IP address.\n",
    "16. The answer is option D becuase If the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA\n",
    "17. The answer is option D, since you need to address the lack of skills, devices, and internet access to completely close the gap, all three actions (I, II, and III) are necessary.\n",
    "22. The answer is option B as the Boolean expression evaluates to true when counter (the number of temperatures greater than or equal to 90) is greater than 50% of total (the number of entries in the list).\n",
    "23. The answer is option B. If there's only one way to get from one point to another, you can't have redundancy. For example, since the path from P to S has to go through R and Q, if any one of those pieces breaks, the connection is completely lost.\n",
    "24. The correct answer is C as this process is lossless because you can always get the original message back perfectly. For example, if you change '111' to '11' and '000' to '00', you can just swap them back later to restore the exact starting string.\n",
    "28. The correct answer is D as using 8 bits will only allow for up to 256 characters, (2^8 = 256)\n",
    "\n",
    "29. Option A is correct as With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output of false. Since both inputs to the second OR gate will be false, the circuit will have an output of false\n",
    "32. Option A is correct as the Xs indicating participants who are interested in the application, are clustered toward the top of the graph.This indicates that participants who read more were generally more likely to say they are interested in the application.\n",
    "34. Option D is correct as the number of predators is initialized at the beginning of the program but is never updated\n",
    "35. Correct answer is D as Creative Commons licenses can be used by creators of digital music to specify how the samples can be used by others. A no-rights-reserved license allows others to freely make use of the samples\n",
    "36. option B is correct because the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating-point numbers) limits the range of floating-point values.\n",
    "38. Option C is correct. The expression count MOD 10 = 0 evaluates to true when count is a multiple of 10, and so this\n",
    "code segment sets cost to 0 under the appropriate conditions.\n",
    "39. Option A is correct as open standards and protocols are used to prescribe the format of data sent over the Internet. This allows all connected hardware and software to communicate in a standard way.\n",
    "41. Option B is correct.  This expression uses the Max procedure to replace the midterm score with the higher of the two scores. The selected value is then added to the final exam score and assigned to adjustedTotal.\n",
    "43. Option A is correct as the pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time\n",
    "47. Option D is correct, because in public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key\n",
    "51. Option B is correct as this is an example of symmetric encryption because the secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages\n",
    "54. Option D is correct. The procedures square and cube are each used to determine a power of n. A generalization of this procedure\n",
    "is Power(n,m) which calculates n raised to the m power.\n",
    "55. Option D is correct. The expression (response = 'y') AND, open(response = 'yes') always evaluates to false because it is not possible for the variable response to be equal to both 'y' and  \"yes\", close quotation. Therefore, the procedure will always\n",
    "return false.\n",
    "57. Option B is correct because this expression concatenates the first two letters of \"Harp\" with the last three letters \"puppy\" resulting in \"Happy\"\n",
    "59. Option B is correct as using lossy compression will provide only an estimate of the original video data. The full-quality original versions of the videos will be lost if lossy compression is used.\n",
    "61. Option A is correct because it is possible to create a single list of student names, sorted by last name. Both data formats provide the first and last names of each student.\n",
    "Option B is also correct as it is possible to determine the average number of days students are absent. Both data formats provide the number of absences for each student.\n",
    "62. Option C is correct As any user has the ability to edit articles, there will be many opportunities for people with different perspectives to contribute.\n",
    "Option D is also correct as the online encyclopedia can be edited at any time, so it is easy to create or update articles as new information becomes available.\n",
    "63. Option B is correct. If count is set to 0 repeatedly inside the loop, it will not provide an accurate count of the number of prime\n",
    "numbers in the list. Option D is correct since If count is incremented outside the IF statement, it will increase for all entries in the list instead of just the prime entries.\n",
    "64. Option B is correct because cloud computing encourages new ways to communicate and collaborate, allowing users to share files and tools easily. Option C is correct as cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data.\n",
    "65. Option B i s correct If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases. Option D is also correct because If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases.\n",
    "66. Option C is correct. The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list [30, 40, 20, 10], the procedure returns 20, which is not the least value in the list. Option D is also correct as the procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list [40, 30, 20, 10], the procedure returns 30, which is not the least value in the list.\n",

    "## How have I improved through the trimester:\n",
    "Over the course of Trimester 1, I have improved significantly in both my technical and collaborative skills. At the beginning of the trimester, I struggled with coding and often felt unsure about how to solve technical problems. However, by the end of the trimester, my technical skills and understanding of code improved a lot—I can now fix my own errors and understand coding concepts much better. My Tech Growth score increased from a 3 to a 5, showing how much progress I made through consistent effort and learning. I also improved in communication and advocacy, becoming more confident in sharing my ideas and supporting my teammates during discussions. My strong work habits, organization, and positive attitude remained consistent throughout, as I continued to complete all assignments on time and stay focused in class. Overall, I grew not just in skill, but also in confidence and teamwork, making me a stronger and more independent learner than I was at the start of the trimester.\n"

    "At the beginning of the year, I was still figuring out the basics of how everything in computer science connected — from GitHub to Python to web development. Now, I’ve grown a lot more confident in my coding abilities and understanding of how different parts of a project come together. I’ve learned how to debug effectively, think through problems logically, and use new tools without being afraid to experiment.\n",

    "**Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python:** I built a stronger foundation in both languages — learning about variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. It also helped me understand how Python is great for backend logic and how JavaScript makes web pages interactive.  \n",
    "**West Coast Travel / Digital Famine:** This sprint was really fun because it let me apply what I learned to an actual project. I liked how it mixed creativity with technical skills, and it gave me experience working on something that felt real and meaningful.\n",
